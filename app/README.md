How to download StudentSignIn
The StudentSignIn app can be ran 3 ways:
•	Virtually (WARNING - My computer cannot run virtually due to it not being powerful enough)
•	On an Android Device via a connector or Wi-Fi (Version which I use)
•	Downloaded via an APK file (Version I used to demonstrate my FYP)

(DOCUMENT HAS BEEN SENT WITH WITH IMAGES TO FOLLOW ALSO ON THE UPLOAD)

Here are the steps to do each:

1.	Run project on Android Studio

--Virtual Device--

2.	Using a virtual device allows you simply to run the code and view how it works

3.	If there are no current devices selected, you can simply go to “Device Manager” and add one
 
4.	Once the + button is selected choose “Create a Virtual Device” and choose whichever device best suites. 

--Android Device via Wi-Fi--

5.	You can also select the virtual device which will allow you to dropdown options which enable you to connect your device via Wi-Fi
 
6.	This will present you with a QR code when once scanned connects the device to Android Studio, allowing you to run the project on your phone

--APK File--
 
7.	Finally there is also the option of going to Build -> Build App Bundle(s) / APK(s) -> Build APK(s)
 
8.	Once it builds click locate and send this APK to yourself via email. Then install this on your physical device.
